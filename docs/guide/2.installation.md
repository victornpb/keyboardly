## Install Keyboardly

There are two ways to install the package.

### 1. Package Manager

```bash
# npm
npm i keyboardly

# Yarn
yarn add keyboardly
```

In your application, import the `keyboardly` module, and the core CSS:

```js
import Keyboardly from 'keyboardly';
import 'keyboardly/dist/keyboardly.css'; // optional for styling
```

This assumes you're using a module bundler like webpack, Rollup, or Parcel.

The core CSS is not required, but provides a base styling for you to use. If
you'd like to use Keyboardly without any of the default styles
or CSS, see [Styling](../Styling/).

### 2. CDN

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/keyboardly@0.2.0/dist/style.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/keyboardly@0.2.0/dist/keyboardly.js"></script>
```

Place them at the very bottom of the `<body>`, ensuring they are placed before
your own scripts. The version numbers after `@` are important, make sure they
don't get removed.
